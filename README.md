FreezePlayers is a simple yet powerful plugin designed to give server administrators full control over the ability to walk. 
It allows you to freeze individual players or even the entire server with ease. Whether you're dealing with a troublemaker, 
organizing a special event, or simply want to catch a player's attention, FreezePlayers is the perfect tool for the job.

With the /freezeplayer command, administrators or command blocks can instantly freeze a specific player, ensuring they are unable to 
move but can interact with world around them, ensuring players could, for example, select a kit for a minigame. This feature can be useful for resolving conflicts, moderating player behavior, or creating amazing live events.

In addition, the plugin allows you to freeze entire teams or groups of playersâ€”ideal for organizing mini-games, 
team-based challenges, or competitions. You can use this feature to halt certain teams at key moments during
gameplay, ensuring for example an announcement saying: "golden apples dropped at x:100 y:20"

Here is the list of all features of the FreezePlayers plugin:

Single Player Freeze: Freeze individual players using the /freezeplayer <player> command.

Global Freeze: Freeze the entire server at once, with /freezeplayer @a, great for event coordination, minigames, or catching dupers in the act.

Team Freeze: Freeze specific teams or groups of players, useful for mini-games, competitions, or PvP events.

Unfreeze Command: Easily unfreeze players or teams by retyping the freeze command
